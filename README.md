### Getting started

The conference application store data in [Sanity]() using the [Sanity JS Client](https://www.sanity.io/docs/js-client). It fetches data from [CVPartner](https://cv.miles.no) to get information about office locations and people.

In the root of the project, there is a `.env.example` file that need to be cloned and named `.env`. In this file all the secrets that need to be set should go. For the API-token, ask to get one.

The development branch (dev branch) is where all development is happening. On every checking to this branch there is triggered a Github Action that build and deploy the application to the development site on Azure.
